The fields are the same size in width and height, and are limited in size from 2 to 26 cells. On each of the available fields, the player has a certain number shots When entering any of these fields, the user can fire a shot by clicking on a cell of the field.\n\n⁃ With a shot, the player hits only one cell. All ships are single-deck; if a ship is hit, this will be enough to destroy it and receive a prize.\n⁃ Ships can be located on adjacent cells, unlike the original rules of “Sea Battle”.\n⁃ On the field, all players who have access to it can shoot.\n⁃ A player cannot shoot at a cell that another player or himself previously shot at.\n⁃ Cells at which shots were fired are marked with crosses or squares. A square means that there was a ship at the site of the shot, a cross, that the place where the shot was fired was empty.\n⁃ The arrangement of ships does not change after the first shot is fired.\n⁃ The number of shots for each player is assigned by the field administrator and can be changed during the game."
